			<h1> Munchkin cat </h1>
			<hr>
				<ul>
					<li>The Munchkin is a medium sized cat, moderate in body type and head shape, with a thick, plush coat. </li>
					<li>The Munchkin is notable for their leg length as owing to a genetic mutation, the Munchkin has very short legs, which in turn gives the cat a rather long, low appearance.  </li>
					<li>These cats usually live healthy and normal lives. They donâ€™t develop any hip or spin problems. But then, ensuring you get your cat from breeders with a written health assurance is still vital.</li>
					<li>Munchkin cats are famous for their skill to perch like ferrets or prairie dogs on their hind legs. This is probably due to their slightly extended hind legs.</li>
