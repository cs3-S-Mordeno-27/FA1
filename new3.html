					<li>The Siamese is a long, elegant cat. The body is long, the neck is long, the legs and tail are long. </li>
					<li>The name Siamese cat translates to wichien-matt which means “moon diamond. </li>
					<li>Siamese cats originated in Thailand, an area once known as Siam. Some stories suggest that they were first raised by Buddhist monks. Other tales say that the first Siamese cats were adopted by royalty. There is some actual documentation of this (records of them being adopted by royals go far back as 1350).</li>
					<li>Siamese cats are born white. Their darker fur doesn’t appear until they are several weeks old. Although the classic Siamese tips were dark, today breeders also allow blue, chocolate, and lilac.</li>
